2)Introduced by pioneers like Edsger Dijkstra, structured programming advocated for modular, readable, and maintainable code.
Programming languages such as C, Pascal, and Ada emerged, supporting better software design.
The introduction of the Waterfall Model by Winston Royce in 1970 provided a systematic approach to software development with phases like requirements, design, implementation, testing, and maintenance.
The Advent of Agile Methodology (2001 – Agile Manifesto)

3)The Agile Manifesto was published in 2001 by software developers seeking more flexible, collaborative, and iterative development methods.
Agile methodologies, including Scrum and Kanban, became widely adopted, replacing rigid models like Waterfall.
Agile emphasized customer collaboration, rapid iteration, adaptability, and continuous improvement, leading to the modern DevOps movement and CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) practices.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a structured process for developing high-quality software efficiently. It consists of several phases, each with a specific purpose.
1. Planning
The project’s feasibility, scope, objectives, and estimated resources are determined.
Risk analysis and budgeting are conducted to ensure viability.
2. Requirements Gathering & Analysis
Stakeholders define and document the software’s functional and non-functional requirements.
Business analysts and developers analyze requirements for feasibility and consistency.
3. Design
The system architecture, user interface, database design, and other technical details are planned.
High-level (system architecture) and low-level (detailed module design) designs are created.
4. Implementation (Coding & Development)
Developers write the actual code based on the design specifications.
Programming languages, frameworks, and tools are selected based on project needs.
5. Testing
Software is tested for bugs, security vulnerabilities, and performance issues.
Different types of testing, such as unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and user acceptance testing, are performed.
6. Deployment
The software is released into the production environment.
Deployment strategies include phased rollout, parallel deployment, or direct implementation.
7. Maintenance & Support
Continuous monitoring and updates are performed to fix bugs, enhance features, and ensure security.
Patches, upgrades, and performance optimizations are applied as needed.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
1. Approach
Waterfall: Follows a sequential and linear approach where each phase must be completed before moving to the next.
Agile: Uses an iterative and incremental approach, allowing for continuous development and feedback.
2. Flexibility
Waterfall: Rigid; changes are difficult to implement once a phase is completed.
Agile: Highly flexible; changes can be made at any stage based on feedback.
3. Development Phases
Waterfall: Clearly defined phases (e.g., planning, design, coding, testing), and each phase must be completed before proceeding.
Agile: Phases are continuous; development, testing, and feedback occur in iterative cycles (sprints).
4. Client Involvement
Waterfall: Minimal client involvement after initial requirements gathering.
Agile: High client involvement with frequent collaboration and iterations.
5. Testing
Waterfall: Testing occurs at the end of the development process.
Agile: Continuous testing throughout the development cycle.
